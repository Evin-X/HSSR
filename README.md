#### __$\bullet$ Introduction__

Frame cameras suffer from limited shutter speed and motion blur, which causes a substantial deficiency in latency and accuracy when recognizing high-speed objects. Spike
cameras have a high temporal resolution (i.e., 50ùúáùë†), leading to a stronger capability of recording high-speed motions, as illustrated in the following,

This work proposes a recognition framework that learns feature-level associations between short-term and long-term streams. The framework contains three components: a feature extractor, a spike encoder, and a decoder, as illustrated in the following,

#### __$\bullet$ Download Datasets__ 

This work constructs a large-scale spiking recognition dataset, which contains S-ImageNet and S-CARS.

S-ImageNet is collected using a high-speed motion platform set up in the laboratory. S-CARS is collected using a spike camera to capture high-speed moving vehicles in real-world scenarios.

Several samples in the S-ImageNet are visualized in the following,
